Use your acme template to build a registration view and store it into the "view" folder.
 The view must contain a form that collects the following information from a site visitor:
First name
Last name
Email address
A password
Ensure that the registrant understands that all fields are required, but you do not need to enforce the require right now, this is just a notification.

Make sure you use HTML5 and usability standards to build the view and form 
(e.g. use label elements with the input elements and use HTML5 input types for the input elements within the form).

Use CSS to style the form for professional appearance and usability.
